        The Phoenicians used the gulf as their trading centre and built the
        wonderful city of Tharros; the most important evidence of the ancient
        Nuragic culture is still evident in this territory such as mysterious
        sacred wells, imposing nuraghi (megalithic edifices) and the fascinating
        Giganti (giants) of Monteâ€™ and Prama. The Gulf also features a sea with
        clear waters, protected from strong currents and winds; you can relax in
        this hospitable, spontaneous and familiar environment, far from the
        chaos of typical seaside resorts, and enjoy swimming, fishing and
        playing sports. It is the ideal destination for cycling holidays: little
        traffic and plain lands featuring a wide range of routes among, ponds,
        salt marshes and lagoonse. You can discover the peaceful and uncrowded
        beaches of Santa Giusta stretching near the wetland that earned
        international importance as it is protected by the RAMSAR Convention;
        from the small village going along the pond, you will reach the large
        and solitary beaches with shallow waters surrounded by small dunes
        giving habitat to wild lilies. The beach of Torregrande is among the
        most popular, but you will never find it crowded because it is a very
        long beach: in the evening, the waterfront bars and kiosks turn into
        venues for concerts, parties and gatherings or just a place to enjoy the
        sea breeze with friends. Among the finest in the Gulf, you will discover
        the very quiet and peaceful beaches of Arborea with their crystal clear
        waters, white sand and a fragrant pine forest that offers a dash of
        fresh air during the hottest of summer days. This is the ideal area for
        those who love to go horseback riding which is also a passion of the
        locals and equestrian tourism lovers who will find the best riding
        schools and services. By riding a horse, you can go from the beaches to
        the lagoons where you will find nesting birds, some of which are very
        rare, and it is easy to bump into the flight of the pink flamingos.
        Horses are the main attraction even in traditional festivals: at Sedilo
        in July, brave knights compete in frantic downhill race towards the
        sanctuary of San Costantino (Saint Constantine). In occasion of the
        Sartiglia, during the Carnival in Oristano, equestrian tournaments are
        held in which men, women and children perform with agility stunts and
        challenge each other trying to hit the centre of the star while running
        on their horses. The traditions of this Festival is repeated with the
        same rituals since the Middle Ages; it attracts thousands of tourists
        who, along with the locals, support and spur the knights that dress
        elegant traditional Sardinian and Spanish mountain clothes, ride on
        horses harnessed with coloured tassels and satins racing in exciting
        acrobatics and jousts.
