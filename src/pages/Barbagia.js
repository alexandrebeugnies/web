        The Barbagia is the heart of Sardinia. A vast territory that encompasses
        the slopes of the Gennargentu, the massive mountain range at the centre
        of the island, and the lower peaks that surround it. The name Barbaria
        comes from the fact that it was here that the Sardinians took refuge as
        they resisted the onslaught of Carthaginians and Romans. There is, in
        fact, more than one Barbagia and the area is composed of various
        historical regions: the Barbagia of Belvì, of Bitti (the northernmost
        area), of Nuoro, Ollolai and of Seulo (the southernmost), as well as the
        area of the Mandrolisai, west of Gennargentu. You will be enchanted by
        the picturesque historic centres of the small towns, with their granite
        houses, coortes and the overhanging vines that line the narrow streets.
        Like, for example, at Gavoi, home of the famous Fiore Sardo cheese. At
        Orgosolo the streets seem to talk to you via the murales, wall paintings
        that tell of life, culture and local politics. The Barbagia is famous
        for the internationally renowned cannonau wines made at Mamoiada, Oliena
        and Dorgali. If you love outdoor activity then go to the Supramonte,
        where the white of the rocks, the green of the vegetation and the blue
        sky come together with stunning chromatic beauty. At Oliena you’ll find
        the su Gologone springs and the valle di Lanaittu, where the island’s
        oldest human remains have come to light, and the village of Tiscali,
        where, legend has it, the last Sardinians sought refuge from invading
        conquerors. At Orgosolo you can go to the Montes forest and enjoy
        gorgeous views of the top of mount Novu santu Juvanne. You can walk all
        the way to the lovely Nuraghe Mereu, built with white calcareous rock,
        and the impressive Gorropu canyon, with 450m high walls, home of the
        royal eagle. For a well-rounded understanding of Barbagian culture and
        tradition, visit the Museum of Sardinian Life and Popular Traditions in
        Nuoro. And to really satisfy your curiosity, don’t miss the
        carnival-like costumes, whose origins reach back to pagan fertility
        rites. Sheepskins, cow bells and masks depicting animal-like snouts and
        deformed faces symbolise the eternal battle between good and evil, life
        and death, the conqueror and the conquered. The most famous costumes are
        the Mamuthones of Mamoiada, the Thurpos at Orotelli and the Merdules of
        Ottana. The masks can also be seen at the museum of the Maschere del
        Mediterraneo in Mamoiada. Another local tradition is Tenores chant-like
        singing, which has earned a well-deserved place on the UNESCO Intangible
        World Heritage list. Its origins date back to time immemorial, when
        shepherds far from home in winter would gather around a fire and sing.
        If you miss hearing a live performance, you can listen to historic
        renditions at the Museo multimediale del Canto a Tenores in Bitti.
