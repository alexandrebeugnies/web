<p className="desccli"> The province of Oristano is known to climbing enthusiasts for its variety of types of walls to practice.
Not far from the hotel and the campsite, near the archaeological excavations of Cornus from the 6th century BC, there are several climbing routes.
Here is what Maurizio Oviglia, one of the leading experts in climbing in Sardinia, writes on the Planet Mountain website: "The region of Santa Caterina di Pittinuri is already known for the beauty of the beaches, it is less so. because of the small basalt cliffs, hidden in the folds of Monti Ferru.
They are not, as I said, large obvious cliffs, but small ridges hidden in the ravines, offering an intensive climb that rarely reaches 20 to 25 meters.
So it makes sense that local climbers often associate rock climbing with bouldering.
Indeed, the two cliffs that we offer each have, in addition to the cliff, their climbing area. â€œCurrently, 49 routes are available in two sectors with a large majority of scores between 5 and 6. </p>

The course was designed by renowned American architects Von Hagge, Smelek and Baril, who introduced the 18 holes in the natural dunes that characterize the area, creating one of the most spectacular courses in Europe, both from the point of view technique than from a landscape point of view.
